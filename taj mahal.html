<pre>  The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, 
in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction 
starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD.
      
       The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectura achievement in the indo-islamic culture.</pre>

<h3> Early summers(from March to June) is the best time to visit the monument. And the best days to plan a visit are between Monday and Thursday.

Avoid winters as the Taj will be shadowed by fog, i.e., from the months of November to February.</h3></center>
